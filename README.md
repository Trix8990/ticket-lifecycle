<h1>osTicket - Ticket Lifecycle: Intake Through Resolution</h1>
This tutorial outlines the lifecycle of a ticket from intake to resolution within the open-source help desk ticketing system osTicket.<br />
<br />
The ticket lifecycle in osTicket represents the journey of a support ticket from the moment it is created to the point it is resolved and closed. This process is crucial to ensuring effective support and customer satisfaction. Below is a detailed overview of each phase in the osTicket ticket lifecycle, from intake to resolution.<br />


<h2>1. Ticket Submission</h2>
<h4>Source: Tickets can be submitted through various channels like:</h4>

- Web Portal: A customer fills out a ticket submission form (based on a selected help topic) via your osTicket portal.
- Email: A customer sends an email to a designated support address (e.g., support@yourcompany.com), and osTicket automatically creates a ticket from the email.
- Phone: An agent manually creates a ticket based on phone interactions with the customer.
- API: Tickets can be created via osTicketâ€™s REST API for integrations with third-party systems.

<h4>Key Elements at Intake:</h4>

- Help Topic: The customer or agent selects a help topic (e.g., "Technical Support", "Billing Inquiry"). This helps categorize the ticket for routing to the correct department or team.
- Ticket Form Fields: Depending on the department or help topic, the form may include different custom fields, such as name, email, phone number, subject, description, and attachments.
- Ticket Priority: The ticket may be automatically or manually assigned a priority (e.g., Low, Medium, High, Critical).
- SLA (Service Level Agreement): If configured, SLAs are applied based on the ticket's priority and help topic, defining expected response and resolution times.

<h2>2. Ticket Routing and Assignment</h2>
<h4>Ticket Routing:</h4>

- Automatic Assignment: Based on the help topic, ticket priority, or other predefined rules, osTicket can automatically assign tickets to a specific department (e.g., Sales, Support, Billing).
- Manual Assignment: An agent or supervisor can manually assign the ticket to a specific team member or group of agents.

<h4>Key Elements in Routing:</h4>

- Department Assignment: The ticket is assigned to the relevant department based on the help topic or manual intervention.
- Agent Assignment: A specific agent within the department is either automatically or manually assigned to handle the ticket.
