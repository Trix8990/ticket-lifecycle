<h1>osTicket - Ticket Lifecycle: Intake Through Resolution</h1>
This tutorial outlines the lifecycle of a ticket from intake to resolution within the open-source help desk ticketing system osTicket.<br />
<br />
The ticket lifecycle in osTicket represents the journey of a support ticket from the moment it is created to the point it is resolved and closed. This process is crucial to ensuring effective support and customer satisfaction. Below is a detailed overview of each phase in the osTicket ticket lifecycle, from intake to resolution.<br />


<h2>1. Ticket Submission</h2>
<h4>Source: Tickets can be submitted through various channels like:</h4>

- Web Portal: A customer fills out a ticket submission form (based on a selected help topic) via your osTicket portal.
- Email: A customer sends an email to a designated support address (e.g., support@yourcompany.com), and osTicket automatically creates a ticket from the email.
- Phone: An agent manually creates a ticket based on phone interactions with the customer.
- API: Tickets can be created via osTicket’s REST API for integrations with third-party systems.

<h4>Key Elements at Intake:</h4>

- Help Topic: The customer or agent selects a help topic (e.g., "Technical Support", "Billing Inquiry"). This helps categorize the ticket for routing to the correct department or team.
- Ticket Form Fields: Depending on the department or help topic, the form may include different custom fields, such as name, email, phone number, subject, description, and attachments.
- Ticket Priority: The ticket may be automatically or manually assigned a priority (e.g., Low, Medium, High, Critical).
- SLA (Service Level Agreement): If configured, SLAs are applied based on the ticket's priority and help topic, defining expected response and resolution times.

<h2>2. Ticket Routing and Assignment</h2>
<h4>Ticket Routing:</h4>

- Automatic Assignment: Based on the help topic, ticket priority, or other predefined rules, osTicket can automatically assign tickets to a specific department (e.g., Sales, Support, Billing).
- Manual Assignment: An agent or supervisor can manually assign the ticket to a specific team member or group of agents.

<h4>Key Elements in Routing:</h4>

- Department Assignment: The ticket is assigned to the relevant department based on the help topic or manual intervention.
- Agent Assignment: A specific agent within the department is either automatically or manually assigned to handle the ticket.

<h2>3. Agent Review and Acknowledgment</h2>
<h4>Key Actions by Agent:</h4>

- Ticket Acknowledgment: The agent reviews the ticket and acknowledges receipt. This may involve sending an auto-response to the customer.
- Ticket Review: The agent reviews the issue described by the customer.

<h4>Initial Actions:</h4>

- Update Ticket Status: The agent might change the status to "In Progress" if they begin working on the ticket.
- Communication with Customer: The agent may initiate communication by replying to the customer’s request (e.g., asking for more details or providing an initial response).

<h2>4. Ticket Investigation and Work in Progress</h2>
<h4>Actions during Investigation:</h4>

- Ticket Updates: Agents can continue adding notes, responses, or attachments to the ticket.
- Internal Collaboration: Agents may collaborate with other agents, escalate the issue to a higher level, or involve other departments if needed.
- Customer Communication: The agent may keep the customer updated on progress or request additional information.
- Escalation: If the issue is more complex, the agent may escalate the ticket to a manager or specialist for further investigation.


<h4>Key Actions:</h4>

- Change Ticket Status: The status of the ticket may move from "Open" to "In Progress" or "On Hold" if the agent is waiting for a response from the customer.
- SLA Monitoring: If SLAs are set, osTicket will track the ticket’s progress to ensure that the agent meets the required response and resolution times. SLA breaches may trigger automatic alerts.




<h2>5. Resolution and Closure</h2>
<h4>Actions for Resolution:</h4>

- Solution Applied: The agent provides the final solution to the customer or resolves the issue internally.
- Ticket Status Update: The agent changes the ticket status to "Resolved" after the issue has been fixed.
- Customer Feedback Request: The agent may ask the customer to confirm if the issue has been resolved or if further assistance is required.
- Documentation: If necessary, the agent can create knowledge base articles or document the solution for future reference.


<h4>Key Steps for Closure:</h4>

- Change Ticket Status to "Closed": After confirming the customer is satisfied, the agent will mark the ticket as "Closed".
- Email Notification: The customer receives a resolution notification email confirming that the ticket has been resolved and closed.
- Survey: If enabled, a customer satisfaction survey may be sent to the customer for feedback on the support experience.

<h2>6. Post-Resolution (Optional)</h2>
<h4>Follow-Up:</h4>

- Follow-up Tasks: If the customer is not satisfied or if the issue is ongoing, agents may re-open the ticket for further investigation.
- Reopened Ticket: If a customer reports that the issue reoccurs, the agent can re-open the ticket and continue troubleshooting.
- Surveys & Feedback: After resolution, customers may be prompted to fill out a satisfaction survey.


<h4>Key Elements in Post-Resolution:</h4>

- Ticket Rating: If enabled, customers can rate their experience with the agent (via the satisfaction survey).
- Ticket History: The entire history of the ticket, including internal notes, responses, and resolutions, is logged in the system for future reference or reporting.
